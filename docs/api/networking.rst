Network Events
______________

The following events may be generated by the networking system
resolved
    Emitted toward ``InjectionKey(NetworkConfig)`` when a :class:`carthage.network.NetworkConfig` is resolved.  The target is the network config that has resolved;

    :param other_futures: When both sides of a link are configured at the same time, the other side of the link cannot be resolved until its :class:`carthage.Machine` is ready.In this case a future is recorded and included in the event.

    This event is typically used to collect the set of futures for other_links.  When all these futures are *done*, then all effects from resolution of the :class:`NetworkConfig` have been realized.

public_address
    Emitted toward ``InjectionKey(NetworkLink)`` and ``InjectionKey(NetworkLink, host=model.name)`` when some part of the system becomes aware of the public address of a link behind a NAT.  A *public_address* property is set on the link's *merged_v4_config* prior to emitting the event.
